# VolleyExample
We used Book API for this volley example:blush:
In this application,we used third party library like volley is used 
Volley and Async Task both are used for Network Operations
Volley is introduced by overcoming the draw backs of Async Task
In async task,we have to give to the url connections,but in volley it automatically generates the url connections
and Intents are also used in this :blush:
In this example,in mainactivity are images are displayed
when the image is clicked,detail activity is opened 
In detail activity Name of the book title and book description is displayed
This is all about this example:thumbsup:
